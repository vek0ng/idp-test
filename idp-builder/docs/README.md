## Overview

**IDP Builder** is a comprehensive Internal Developer Platform (IDP) setup and management tool that automates the deployment and maintenance of enterprise-grade development infrastructure. It provides a complete solution for setting up GitOps, Infrastructure as Code, and Developer Portal components across multiple cloud providers.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Kubernetes CLI tools
- Cloud provider CLI (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Go 1.21+ (for local development)

### Basic Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vek0ng/idp-stack.git
cd idp-stack/idp-builder

# Check prerequisites
task prerequisites:check-all

# Quick setup for local development
task workflows:setup-development

# Or setup for specific cloud provider
task workflows:setup-production CLUSTER_NAME=my-idp PROVIDER=aws REGION=us-east-1
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

IDP Builder manages three core platform layers:

### 1. Infrastructure Layer
- **Cluster Management**: Multi-provider Kubernetes cluster provisioning
- **Networking**: Ingress controllers, load balancers, DNS management
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, storage classes, backup solutions

### 2. Platform Layer  
- **GitOps (ArgoCD)**: Continuous deployment and application lifecycle
- **Infrastructure as Code (Crossplane)**: Cloud resource provisioning
- **Developer Portal (Backstage)**: Service catalog and developer experience

### 3. Workflow Layer
- **Setup Workflows**: Complete platform initialization
- **Maintenance Workflows**: Ongoing operations and monitoring
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup, restore, and business continuity

## üìã Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **ArgoCD** | GitOps Platform | Continuous deployment, sync policies, multi-cluster |
| **Crossplane** | Infrastructure as Code | Cloud resources, compositions, providers |
| **Backstage** | Developer Portal | Service catalog, documentation, templates |

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Categories

### Core Infrastructure
```bash
task prerequisites:check-all              # Validate environment
task providers:configure-aws              # Setup cloud provider
task cluster:create-cluster               # Create Kubernetes cluster
task networking:setup-ingress             # Configure ingress
task storage:setup-storage                # Setup persistent storage
```

### Platform Management
```bash
task gitops:install-argocd               # Install GitOps platform
task crossplane:install-crossplane       # Install IaC platform  
task backstage:install-backstage         # Install developer portal
```

### Workflow Orchestration
```bash
task workflows:complete-setup            # End-to-end platform setup
task workflows:health-check              # Platform health monitoring
task workflows:backup-all                # Comprehensive backup
task workflows:disaster-recovery         # Business continuity
```
